## What is this?

WIP right now, but the idea is a game in which you start off with virtual $1000 and make bets - i.e. trades - on whether the subcount is going up or down.
The aim is to grow the $1000 as high as possible.

## Rules

- You start off with $1000, and you're able to reset from any value back to $1000 at any time.
- You can choose to go "long" (betting the subcount to increase), or go "short" (betting the subcount to decrease)
- For any position you take, you are awarded/deducted the difference in value between the opening subcount and the closing subcount. This is multiplied by the position size.
- Position size = dollar amount / opening subcount.

## Tools

- You are given a candlestick chart representing the current subcount, and historical subcount over a given period
- Various technical indicators are available
- (future) Latest information about channels and their contraversies will be displayed on your trading UI
- You can select different instruments to trade, such as YouTube subscribers, Twitch followers, Twitter followers.
- (future) You are also given chart statistics, such as RSI, MACD and volume
